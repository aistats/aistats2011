<h1>AISTATS*2011 Call for Papers</h1>
<h2>Fourteenth International Conference on <br>Artificial Intelligence and Statistics</h2>
    <h3>April 11-13, 2011, Ft. Lauderdale, FL, USA 
<br> Hyatt Regency Pier 66
<br> Colocated with the Learning Workshop</h3>



    <p>AISTATS is an interdisciplinary gathering of researchers at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and related areas.&nbsp; Since its inception in 1985, the primary goal of AISTATS has been to broaden research in these fields by promoting the exchange of ideas among them.&nbsp; We encourage the submission of all papers which are in keeping with this objective at <a href="http://www.aistats.org/">www.aistats.org</a>.</p>

<p>The Conference Program will include invited talks, contributed talks, and posters.&nbsp;  Contributed talks and posters will be selected via
a rigorous double-blind peer-review process.&nbsp;  Accepted
papers will be published in the AISTATS Conference Proceedings.</p>

<!-- <p>As an innovation for AISTATS*2010, some time at the conference will
be set aside for "breaking news" posters submitted on the basis of
a one-page abstract.&nbsp;  These are reports on ongoing or unpublished
projects, projects already published elsewhere, partially developed
ideas, negative results etc, and are meant as informal forums to
encourage discussion.&nbsp;  The review process of these posters will be
very light-touch but presentation of these at the Conference will
not lead to publication in the Proceedings.</p> -->

<p>Solicited topics include, but are not limited to:

<ul>
  <li> Bayesian models and estimation (graphical models, causality, Gaussian processes, approximate inference, ...)

  <li> Non-Bayesian models and estimation (kernel methods, nonparametric models, statistical and computational learning theory, manifolds and embedding, sparsity and compressed sensing, ...)

  <li> Classification, regression, density estimation, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, clustering, topic models, ...

  <li> Structured prediction, relational learning, logic and probability
  <li> Reinforcement learning, planning, control
  <li> Game theory, no-regret learning, multi-agent systems
  <li> Algorithms and architectures for high-performance computation in AI and statistics
  <li> Software for and applications of AI and statistics
</ul>

<h3>Submission Requirements</h3>

<!-- <h3>Peer-Reviewed Papers:</h3> -->

<p>We're making some changes to the typical submission and review process for AISTATS.&nbsp; The main changes are: (1) a two-stage reviewing process with more time for the authors to revise their papers, which will hopefully improve the quality of the final versions; and (2) awards for an increased number of notable papers, along with a process for giving these papers increased visibility and discussion, hopefully motivating authors to submit their best work.&nbsp;  See the conference website for more details: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/reviewing.html">reviewing.html</a>.<p>

<p>Electronic submission of papers is required.&nbsp; Papers may be up to 8
double-column pages in length, <b>excluding</b> references; formatting and submission information will be made available on the conference website at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/submit.html">submit.html</a>.

<p>Submissions will be considered if they are received by 23:59, November 1st, 2010, UTC.&nbsp; See the conference website for additional important dates: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dates.html">dates.html</a>.

<p>All accepted papers will be presented at the Conference either as contributed talks or as posters, and will be published in the AISTATS Conference Proceedings.&nbsp; Papers for talks and posters will be treated equally in publication.

<p>Submitted manuscripts should not have been previously published in a journal or in the proceedings of a conference, and should not be under consideration for publication at another conference at any point during the AISTATS review process.&nbsp; It is acceptable to have a substantially extended version of the submitted paper under consideration simultaneously for journal publication, so long as the journal version's planned publication date is in 2011 or later, the journal submission does not interfere with AISTATS's right to publish the paper, and the situation is clearly described at the time of AISTATS submission.&nbsp; Please describe the situation in the appropriate box on the submission page (and do not include author information in the submission itself, to avoid accidental unblinding).
