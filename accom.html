We have arranged a block of rooms and a conference rate at the:
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

These rooms are guaranteed until March 10, 2011 (although the Hyatt may
honor the rate after that date if rooms are still available).&nbsp;
[Update: the rate is good until March 18, 2011 while rooms last.]&nbsp;
Please be sure to use the reservation link above, or to mention our group ID (SAIAS, Society for AI and Statistics) and meeting name (AISTATS 2011) when making a reservation by phone: this will ensure that you get the conference rate, and will also help us ensure that we meet our contracted group size.<p>

In addition, due to limited availability at the Hyatt, the <a
href="http://www.bahiamarhotel.com/">Bahia Mar</a> has agreed to honor
the conference rate of $139/night.&nbsp; They are approximately 1 mile
from the Hyatt, reportedly an easy walk.&nbsp; To reserve, please

After arrival, guests departing earlier than reserved will be charged one (1) night room and applicable tax.
